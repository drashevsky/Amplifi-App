## Inspiration

We were inspired by connecting musicians to their fans during this pandemic - bringing the scene out to everybody, everywhere.

## What it does

Allows fans to keep up with the latest artists' live streams, merch drops, etc.

## How I built it

Built a front-end react app with a back-end in node.js, hosted on digitalocean.

## Challenges I ran into

We initially tried to use azure for hosting, spent several hours on it, and were forced to pivot to digitalocean.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of

Building a slick, beautiful app to connect musicians to their fans.

## What I learned

Hackathons require great discipline and determination to succeed. Going for 24 hours straight and doing work that normally takes 3 weeks of regular dev time is an eye-opening experience.

## Where will Amplifi go next

We plan to scale up and fully implement our API on a more powerful service such as Azure, where our platform can realize its full potential.
